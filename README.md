Cellij (pronounced as "zillÄ«j", derived from [Zellij](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zellij): a style of mosaic tilework made from individually hand-chiseled tile pieces) is a versatile factor analysis framework for rapidly building and training a wide range of factor analysis models on multi-omics data. Cellij builds upon a Bayesian factor analysis skeleton that is designed to provide a wide-ranging customisability at all levels, ranging from likelihoods and optimisation procedures to sparsity-inducing priors.

Cellij is designed for rapid prototyping of custom factor analysis models, allowing users to efficiently define new models in an iterative fashion. The following code snippet shows an example how to setup and train a model with a predefined sparsity prior.
```python
mdata = cellij.Importer().load_CLL()

# 1. We create a new Factor Analysis model
model = cellij.FactorModel(n_factors=10)

# 2. We add an MuData object to the model
model.add_data(mdata)

# 3. We can add some options if we wish
model.set_model_options(
    weight_priors={
        "drugs": "Horseshoe",
        "methylation": "Horseshoe",
        "mrna": "Horseshoe",
    },
)

# 4. We train the model
model.fit(epochs=10000)
```

## Getting started

Please refer to the [documentation][link-docs]. In particular, the

-   [API documentation][link-api].

## Installation

You need to have Python 3.8 or newer installed on your system. If you don't have
Python installed, we recommend installing [Mambaforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge).

There are several alternative options to install cellij:

<!--
1) Install the latest release of `cellij` from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/cellij/>`_:

```sh
pip install cellij
```
-->

1. Install the latest development version:

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/bioFAM/cellij.git@main
```
